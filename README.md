Reimann-Sums
============

Will continue to tweak this, but the project can already serve as an accurate demonstration of how to calculate left, right, mid-point and trapezoidal Reimann sums.

Project utilizes Dave Delong's DDMathParser, which can be found here: https://github.com/davedelong/DDMathParser
